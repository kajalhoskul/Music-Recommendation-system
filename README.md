# Emotion-Based Smart Music Player ðŸŽµ

The Emotion-Based Smart Music Player is a Python application that uses facial recognition and emotion detection to play music based on the user's mood. By analyzing real-time input from a webcam, it identifies emotions such as *happy*, *sad*, *angry*, and *neutral*, and plays corresponding music tracks.

## Features

- **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Recognizes facial emotions using OpenCV and FisherFace models.
- **Mood-Based Music Playback**: Automatically plays music matching your detected mood.
- **Custom Model Training**: Update the emotion detection model using your own dataset.
- **Interactive UI**: A lightweight graphical interface powered by Eel.
- **Dataset Creation**: Captures user images for training and improves model accuracy.
